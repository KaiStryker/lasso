### Lasso Project
Lasso is a multi currency swap protocol that allows users to do multicurrency swaps in on transaction.

### Project Structure
The project is split into two main parts, the client and the smart contracts. 
1. The client is a react app that is used to interact with the smart contract. 
2. The smart contracts are written in solidity and are deployed on the NEAR blockchain.

### Client
The client is a react app that enables users to do a wallet dust sweep which lets users swap their tokens with little amounts in one transaction.
